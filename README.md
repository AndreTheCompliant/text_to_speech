# text_to_speech
This project uses Googles Text to speech API and creates mp3 files out fo text. 

Wavenet was created by researchers at Deepmind and uses a neural network that has been "trained" by real speech. 
Experimenting with this API is super fun since the XML aplication ssml allows us to modify tempo, prosody and other phonetic characteritics in the speech. 

The application so far is a very simple program that reads words from a list and then output those words to a mp3 file. Im hoping to eventuellay build som kind of GUI or website where one could make choices based on how they want the voice to sound.
